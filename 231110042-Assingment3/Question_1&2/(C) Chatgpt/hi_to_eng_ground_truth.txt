First Lady Kim congratulated the Prime Minister on being awarded the Seoul Peace Prize.
The Prime Minister said that this honour truly belongs to the people of India.
The first 100 percent literate city and first 100 percent literate district have been from Kerala.
Kerala was also the first state to attain 100 percent primary education.
Some of the oldest colleges, schools and libraries of the country are also situated in Kerala.
I believe that reading and knowledge should not be limited only to work related aspects.
Their target is to reach 300 million under-privileged people by 2022.
The main objective of this mission is to promote reading as a means to grow and prosper.
Reading can help broaden one’s thinking.
A well-read population will help India excel globally.
With the same spirit, I had started a similar movement by name of VANCHE GUJARAT when I was Chief Minister of the State.
The movement targeted the young generation, in particular.
I appealed to people to give a book instead of bouquet as a greeting.
From the time of the Upanishads persons with knowledge have been respected through the ages.
We are now in the information age.
Even today, knowledge is the best guiding light.
I would like to see such a reading and library movement in the entire country.
The movement should not be limited to make people literate.
It should try to achieve the real goal of bringing social and economic change.
The foundation of good knowledge should be followed by a super-structure of a better society.
I am happy to note that the State Government has announced 19th June as the reading day.
Obviously, a lot of effort will converge to make this a popular activity.
The Government of India has also provided support to the activities of the foundation.
I am told that about 1.20 crore rupees have been given to the foundation in the last two years.
It has the capacity to make a better society and nation.
It was Atal Ji’s exemplary leadership that set the foundations for a strong, prosperous and inclusive India in the 21st century.
His futuristic policies across various sectors touched the lives of each and every citizen of India.
Atal Ji’s passing away is a personal and irreplaceable loss for me.
I have countless fond memories with him.
He was an inspiration to Karyakartas like me.
Replace Tai Khamti’ instead of ‘Khampti’ at serial No. 6.
Inclusion of ‘Mishmi-Kaman’ (Miju Mishmi), Idu (Mishmi) and Taraon (Digaru Mishmi) in serial No. 8.
Inclusion of Monpa, Memba, Sartang, Sajolong (Miji) in serial No. 9 in lieu of ‘Momba’.
Saddened by his passing away.
26 islands have been listed for holistic development.
The Prime Minister also congratulated all those who were associated with this remarkable feat.
Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that it was indeed significant that the junior-most and senior-most officers are spending such a lot of time communicating with each other.
He urged all officers to speed up the adoption of Government e- Marketplace (GeM) in their respective departments.
He said this would eliminate middlemen, and result in savings for the government.
This is the seventh interaction in the series by the Prime Minister through video conference with various beneficiaries of Government schemes.
Today, I got the opportunity to launch the new Chartered Accountancy Course Curriculum.
This is the identity of your Dynamic Course and the Credibility of Examinations.
I am hopeful that this new course will further consolidate the financial skills of new aspirants joining this profession.
While new laws have been formulated, older laws have been made more stringent now.
As reported by the Swiss Bank Authorities, the black money deposits of Indian Nationals have a hit a record all time low.
And I am fully aware of the fact that eliminating fake companies and taking action against black money can be politically incorrect and pose a risk to any political party.
But someone has to take such tough decisions for the sake of the country.
It is estimated that there are more than crore engineers and management graduates in our country.
There are more than 8 lakh doctors.
And for that you also have to take tough steps.
